**📊 COVID-19 in Southeast Asia using SQL and [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/SouthEastAsiaCovidAsofNovember2023/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) 🌏**

🌐 Objective: 
The goal of this project was to analyze and visualize key COVID-19 metrics, including the number of cases, deaths, vaccinations, additional dosages, and the fatality rate, across Southeast Asian countries.

🔑 Key Metrics and SQL ETL Process:

1.) Total Cases and Deaths:
>Leveraging SQL queries, I extracted and transformed data to showcase the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in each Southeast Asian country.
>Aggregated data from reliable sources to ensure accuracy and consistency.

2.) Vaccination Metrics:
>Utilizing SQL, I orchestrated the extraction and transformation of vaccination data, showcasing the number of individuals who received their primary doses and additional dosages.
>Merged datasets to provide a comprehensive overview of vaccination in every country.

3.) Fatality Rate Calculation:
>Implemented SQL scripts to calculate the fatality rate by combining case and death data, shedding light on the severity of the virus in different regions.
