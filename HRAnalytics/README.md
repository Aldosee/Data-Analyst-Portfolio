**About this project**

Hello, I want to test and try my skills as an entry-level data analyst. I used public data in Kaggle to visualize the human resource management status, especially of its employees. The visualization helped identify the goal of the analysis.

**Motive**:
Practice my data analysis and show the human resource development's condition to its employees and address the findings.


ðŸŽ¯ **Goal in this analysis**

1.) Identify what Department has the highest number of employees and its age group.

2.) What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?  

3.) Identify the highest peak of hires and resignations.

4.) Are there areas of the company where pay is not equitable?

5.) Can we predict who is going to terminate and who isn't? What level of accuracy can we achieve on this?
