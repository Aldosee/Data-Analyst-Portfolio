**üìöDSA Financial - Excel with Data and Dashboard**

Hello everyone and this is my practice file in Excel to improve and showcase my skills as an aspiring data analyst. In this project, I use Excel functions and the PIVOT table to arrive at a comprehensive result of identifying sales and cost then use data visualization to highlight trends and outliers.

DSA Financial illustrates the 5 countries in their sales history, total sales, total profit, units sold per segment, and COGS for the years 2013 and 2014 and shows a comparative analysis between sales and profit margin.

‚ùó*Note: This is a practice project, further improvements will be made. As of *March 03, 2024* this is the progress of my work.*
