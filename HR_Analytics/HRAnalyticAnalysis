TOOLS
• Powerbi - import the .csv Excel file to PowerBi and use it to visualize the work through charts, lines, and bar graphs to answer the goal of the analysis.
• Excel - data extraction, data manipulation, and data analysis.
• Figma - used this to compile my finished output and extract it to a PDF file.
• Notepad - record my step-by-step process and jot down the flow of work from scratch to finish.
• Miro - an online platform to make sticky notes and come up with ideas like workflow on how to start the analysis. Data extraction, data analysis, and data visualization.

PROCEDURE
1. Download File
>Start by downloading a public dataset from Kaggle. Ensure you have proper permissions and access to the data.

2. Data Exploration and Preparation
>Begin data exploration by opening the dataset in your preferred data analysis tool. Examine the structure, columns, and data quality. In this phase, the goal of the analysis is found.

3. Schema Design in MIRO
>Consider creating a schema in MIRO to visualize the relationships between different data entities. Start with rough sketches, keeping in mind that this is a learning process.

4. Identifying Primary Key and Foreign Key
(I wanted to try it out if I can make a data model. It's really hard and I don't know if I did it right..)***
>The most challenging part for an entry-level analyst is identifying primary and foreign keys. Utilize internet resources to learn how to define these keys for the dataset.

5. Excel Data Organization
>In Excel, organize your data according to the schema you designed in MIRO. Ensure columns have clear labels and match your schema. Data manipulation to further improve the analysis.

6. Data Visualization in PowerBI
>Import the prepared Excel data into PowerBI. Create data visualizations that explore and represent insights from the data.

7. PowerBI Data Transformation
>Describe the data transformation steps, such as DAX calculations and Power Query edits, e.g., age grouping, changing values, and date manipulations. (This is just basic Power Query edits that I searched online, I am really thankful for the internet where I can learn more.)*
